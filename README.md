# React Tutorial
Throughout this tutorial, we will be creating a modern, single-page, progressive web-application. Each 'part' of the project is self-contained inside its own folder with its own index.html, package.json, and source files. Subsequent parts will iterate on each other. This tutorial will utilize the following libraries and features:

## Libraries
* Webpack 2 - build tool
* Babel - transpiler to support ES6+
* React - component-based view library
* Redux - predictable state management
* Redux-Saga - side-effect modeling middleware
* React-Router - app routing
* SASS - easier CSS
* Express.js - Node.js development server for hosting application
* ESLint - better JavaScript linting for consistent code style

## Features
* Testing
    * Karma - test runner
    * Mocha - test framework
    * Chai - test assertions
    * Sinon - creating test mocks, spies, stubs
* Hot Module Reloading - immediately show code changes on browser
* Code-splitting (lazy-loading routes) - for smaller initial page load
* Service Workers - updates our application in the background
