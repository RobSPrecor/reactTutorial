# React Tutorial
Throughout this tutorial, we will be creating a modern, single-page, progressive web-application. Each 'part' of the project is self-contained inside its own folder with its own index.html, package.json, and source files. Subsequent parts will iterate on each other. This tutorial will utilize the following libraries and features:

## Libraries
* [Webpack 2](https://webpack.js.org/) - build tool
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - transpiler to support ES6+
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - component-based view library
* [React-Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) - app routing
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) - predictable state management
* [Redux-Saga](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga) - side-effect modeling middleware
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) - easier CSS
* [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) - Node.js-based development server for hosting applications
* [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) - better JavaScript linting for consistent code style

## Features
* Testing
    * [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html) - test runner
    * [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) - test framework
    * [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) - test assertions
    * [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) - creating test mocks, spies, stubs
* Hot Module Reloading - immediately show code changes on browser
* Code-splitting (lazy-loading routes) - for smaller initial page load
* Service Workers - updates our application in the background
